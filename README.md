# reactReduxTableTennisBracket

In the beginning I created this repository and tournament.json. 

And the JSON was without players, void(0); no css, no javascript (yet). Just a repository, a mission, a plan.

And on 28th of january i'll say: Let there be table tennis : and there will be a table tennis tournament.
And prizes. And beer. And fun!

Early bird confirmations pls via completing [tournament.json](tournament.json) & pull request :)
